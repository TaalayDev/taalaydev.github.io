                <h3>6.1 Accuracy and Updates</h3>
                <p>While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date educational content, we do not guarantee that all information is complete, accurate, or current. Language content, including vocabulary, grammar, and cultural notes, may be updated periodically to improve educational quality.</p>
                
                <h3>6.2 Educational Effectiveness</h3>
                <p>Tsuzuki Connect is designed as a supplementary language learning tool. We do not guarantee specific learning outcomes or fluency levels. Individual results may vary based on frequency of use, prior knowledge, and personal learning aptitude.</p>

                <p>The Japanese language content, including vocabulary, kanji, grammar points, and cultural notes, is provided for educational purposes only. The sequencing and presentation of language content is based on our teaching methodology and may differ from other language learning resources or formal Japanese language curricula.</p>
