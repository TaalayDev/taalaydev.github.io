    <h1>PixelVerse Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>Last updated: March 18, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>PixelVerse ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application PixelVerse (the "App").</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>PixelVerse primarily stores all your artwork and settings locally on your device. However, we may collect the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purchase Information</strong>: If you make purchases through the App, payment information is processed by app store platforms (Apple App Store or Google Play). We receive only confirmation of the purchase, not your actual payment details.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you use our App, we may automatically collect certain information, including:</p>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Information about how you use our App, such as frequency of use, features used, and preferences selected.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Data</strong>: In case of App crashes or errors, we collect diagnostic information to improve the App's stability.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our App and its contents</li>
        <li>Fulfill and manage purchases and subscriptions</li>
        <li>Respond to your requests and inquiries</li>
        <li>Fix bugs and improve the App's functionality</li>
        <li>Monitor the usage of our App for product improvement</li>
        <li>Protect the security and integrity of our App</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your pixel art creations and app settings are stored locally on your device.</p>
    
    <p>We implement measures designed to secure any personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties except in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We may share information with third-party vendors, service providers, and other contractors who perform services on our behalf, but only what is necessary for them to provide these services.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, user information may be among the transferred assets.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>You have control over your personal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: All locally stored data can be removed by clearing the App's data through your device settings or uninstalling the App.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our App integrates the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong>: We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage statistics to improve the App. This service may collect information such as how often you use the App and which features you use most.</li>
        <li><strong>In-App Purchases</strong>: Payments are processed through Apple App Store or Google Play, depending on your device. Their respective privacy policies apply to the payment process.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information.</p>
    
    <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>If you use our App outside of the United States, your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where our servers are located. By using our App, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have different data protection rules than those of your country.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will post the new privacy policy in the App and update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
    <p>We will notify you of any significant changes by displaying a prominent notice within the App or by sending you an email notification (if you've provided us with your email for cloud services).</p>
